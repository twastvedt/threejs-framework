# threejs-framework
This is my first project in TypeScript and my first large project in three.js. The goal is to create a template using npm, TypeScript, three.js, and Browserify. I have a couple actual projects in mind, but they would both be complex enough to benefit from a multi-file approach, and will need a way to cleanly handle multiple scenes. Comments and suggestions welcome!
